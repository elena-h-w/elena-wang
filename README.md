# Elena Wang – Personal Website

Live site: https://elenahw.com  
Deployed on Vercel

## Overview

This is my personal website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

The site highlights:
- My work in AI product marketing and GTM
- Hands-on AI experimentation (Impact Logger and future projects)
- How I think about AI product mechanics and growth

The goal was to create a minimal, fast, content-focused site that reflects clarity of thinking rather than visual complexity.

## Why This Exists

I believe marketing leaders in AI should understand product mechanics, model economics, and system design — not just positioning.

This site serves as a living portfolio of that work.
